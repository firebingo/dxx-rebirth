### MSYS2 example batch files

These scripts add the mingw-w64 DLL directory to `PATH`, then run a locally built copy of Descent. They assume MSYS2 is installed at its default location `C:\msys64`, along with dxx-rebirth's dependencies; see the [MSYS2 build instructions](../../INSTALL.markdown#compiling-with-msys2).

How to use:
* Copy the appropriate batch file to the same directory as the executable you just built. For example, put `d2x-64bit.bat` along with your 64-bit build of `d2x-rebirth.exe` in the Descent 2 data directory.
* Run the batch file.
